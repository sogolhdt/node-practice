# nodejs-practice
this small project was made as I was practicing coding in NodeJs
# what it does
I created two data models for tour and user as well as the controllers and router, the tour part is about creating a traveling tour, updating and deleting. and the user part contains few APIs for signing up a new user, getting the mobile number and sending a random number as a verification code, if the code given by the user is correct,server sends a personal token for the user
which they can use to set a password or change it
